# javascript-hoisting

-   JavaScript Hoisting refers to the process whereby the interpreter allocates memory for variable and function declarations prior to execution of the code. Declarations that are made using var are initialized with a default value of undefined. Declarations made using let and const are not initialized as part of hoisting.
-   Only function and var is hoisting

\*\* Only Declaration are hoisted.

## \*\*\*\* Difference b/w let, const, and var

-   const and let does not create property of window object when they declared top most of code.
-   In let and const, Redeclaring the same variable within the same function or block scope raises a SyntaxError.
